Object Detection
In this problem set, we will implement a single-stage object detector, based on YOLO v1 [1]
and v2 [2]. Unlike the (better-performing) R-CNN models, single-stage stage detectors predict
bounding boxes and classes without explicitly cropping region proposals out of the image or
feature map. This makes them significantly faster to run.
Weâ€™ll train and evaluate our detector on the PASCAL VOC dataset, a standard dataset for
object detection tasks. The full dataset contains a total of 11K train/val data images with
27K labeled objects, spanning 20 classes (Figure 1). To make training faster, though, we will
only use a subset that contains 2.5K images
